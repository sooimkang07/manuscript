This was my first project for T&I, '26-'26. Here is a summary of what I completed with this assignment:

1. Semantically structured my html using best practices (avoided using divs, nested my elements, ensured all styling was exclusive to my css sheet and not my html, tried to be as mindful to ARIA standards as possible within what we've learned and not being responsive design)
2. Crafted a thoughtful response to the selected reading of Michael Rock's "Hooked on a Feeling"
3. Thought of an interactive and cohesive narrative to structure the reading and response together
4. Reset our css with the provided file
5. Styled my html with a css file using best typography/styling practices taught to us in class
6. Main goals I had:
- Make a sticky nav bar
- Make buttons that link to different parts of the page and external links
- Make distinct article headers for each the reading and the response
- Use details to break out of the column-layout and incorporate information outside of just the reading
- Mimic a newspaper article online (NYT-esque)

If I had more time/knew more: 
- Iâ€™d try to incorporate more flex grids with images 
- Have the nav bar change colors as I move through the sections
- Maybe play around with aligning the text left and right in their respective sections?
- include scroll-trigger animations
- maybe change the design layout of the TLDR to be a card-style interaction?
