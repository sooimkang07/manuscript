					<p>We designers love to fashion ourselves as “problem solvers,” but let's face it: the line between solving problems and creating them is <em>blurry</em> at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of heels, or a $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural extravaganza in the Bois de Boulogne?</p>
					<p>The truth is, no matter what designers say, we have never simply answered problems. The act of design vacillates between the functional and the beguiling, often performing one while claiming the other. <span lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier" target="_blank">Le Corbusier</a></span> dismissed the architecture of his <span lang="fr">beaux-arts</span> contemporaries as cloying, while he looked longingly to the brutal utility of the grain elevators and factories devised by American engineers. A half century later, <span lang="nl"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rem_Koolhaas" target="_blank">Rem Koolhaas</a></span> jettisoned function in favor of performance: <em>“functionality is boring; performance is about what role the building plays and what kind of scene it triggers.”</em> There has long been an ideological divide between the utilitarian and the emotional, between rational design and the decorative arts, but the balance of power is shifting: <span class="highlight">In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut's now cleaning up.</span></p>
					<!-- I looked up how to do the span lang on MDN so accessible screen readers would pronounce it correctly since I set my whole html in en. -->
					<p>The empathy economy is <em>booming</em>. <span class="highlight"><strong>Facts are out, feelings are in.</strong></span> This is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand-mania that asserts that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the IRS needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities, politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. <em>(Is it only a matter of time before we're debating our intergalactic positioning?)</em> <span class="highlight">Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it means, but how it makes us <em>feel</em>.</span> A brand is a promise. It's the putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a particular product, place, or individual. So the new handbag makes us feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka, suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look alike, but it all has to <em>feel</em> alike. Whenever we encounter them, we get that familiar brand sensation. That *tingling* tells you it's working.</p>
					<p>So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian, slightly-embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board has long been associated with the softer design arts—fashion, interiors, styling—that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators used them, serious architects <em>didn't</em>. There's no science to it, simply a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of Xeroxed pictures pinned to a foamcore panel or scattered on the studio floor, a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere. Their very vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don't signify any one thing but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a silky kitty, when juxtaposed with an angora bunny, a desiccated dandelion, and an eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the corporeal and becomes the essence of fluffiness. For the professional brand manager, the mood board attempts to render, in a handful of swiped images, some vague quintessence that's difficult to achieve with words.</p>
					<p>For fashion designers who are required to pump out a new set of allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential and highly confidential way to pinpoint explicit references before assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer recalls how when she worked at the brand in the 00's, the mood boards were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch them. The foamcore was covered in different materials—linen for one collection, cotton for another—and the teams was required to use specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time, never stacked, lest the surface was disturbed. As almost proof of how far we've come, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-menswear/raf-simons" target="_blank">last spring for his men's collection</a>, <a href="https://rafsimons.com/" target="_blank">Raf Simmons</a> came right out and superimposed his reference images—a Japanese block print, an antique postcard, an astronaut—directly onto coats and jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to “mood boards you'd pin your favorite images to.”</p>
					<p>As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our clothes or living room to feel, to how we want our minivan or pharmaceutical or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood business continues to expand. <em>(A friend recently told me her therapist encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the feelings related to her recent divorce.)</em> This expansion is fueled, in large part, by the sheer overabundance of available images.</p> 
					<p>It's hard to remember that a couple of decades ago, finding pictures of things was actually quite arduous and involved countless hours of random page flipping. Now a few seconds of furious <span class="no-break">key-stroking</span> produces endless examples to regurgitate. Every possible idea is immediately diluted by retroactive references. That glut of images is constantly resifted through personal curation tools such as Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration websites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFFFOUND!" target="_blank">ffffound.com</a> or <a href="https://vfiles.com/" target="_blank">vfiles.com</a>. Such <span class="no-break">hyper-individualistic</span> online collections, in turn, become <span class="no-break">open-source</span> mood repositories scavenged by branding professionals. <em>Why assemble collections of your own when there are millions that exist ready for appropriation?</em> Need to evoke cozy softness with a vaguely synthetic overtone, an early seventies color palette, and just a touch of glam rock? Missile silo chic? <span class="no-break">Mid-century</span> Crimean beach culture? I can guarantee someone out there has that covered. There are even Pinterest pages dedicated to collecting other mood boards: <em>collections</em> of <em>collections</em>. And then, of course, there is Instagram, which turns every individual life into a social network mood board. <span class="highlight">The carefully curated Instagram account is essentially a personal image management tool: private life as public brand.</span></p>
					<p>While the ascendency of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to the lurking presence of <strong>Big Data</strong>. As vast files of <span class="no-break">meta-data</span> and personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in <span class="no-break">god-knows-where</span>, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences that at least promise something warmer and more human. <span class="highlight">When everything is available all the time and we're inundated with information in every way, shape and form, we're left no choice but to favor what makes us <em>feel</em>.</span></p>

					<p>Design often straddles the line between <em>solving</em> problems and <em>manufacturing</em> them. Could the push to create brands that feel empathetic and relatable <em>actually</em> be more manipulative than useful? At the very least, a chair that promises nothing more than a place to sit fulfills its purpose honestly. A brand that sells “connection,” however, risks crossing into manipulation disguised as authenticity, which can quickly erode trust for the user.</p>
					<p>This tension feels especially relevant to interaction design today. We live in a digital world where automation, infinite feeds, and carefully packaged productions dominate. Against that backdrop, it makes sense that people are drawn to brands promising warmth and emotion. But when does even manufactured human connection begin to feel like another form of over-saturation? If every interaction is engineered to spark a feeling, what happens to truth and clarity? The danger is already observable in "clickbaity" media headlines that prioritize emotional impact over factual reporting, distorting reality in the process.</p>
					<p>I’m struck by the thought that a brand’s emotional coherence may reveal less about its design brilliance and more about our human response to scarcity: <span class="highlight-ii">we crave what we don't have.</span> As Rock observes, <em>“we're left no choice but to favor what makes us feel.”</em> Mood boards and curated branding thrive because they offer an antidote to the cold flood of data. Their success lies not in efficiency or accuracy, but in their ability to evoke a feeling that feels rare in today's information overload.</p>
					<p>Where I part ways with Rock is in assuming that this emotional turn is wholly positive. I see the risk of swinging too far—of trading functional clarity for shallow emotional triggers. We must remind ourselves to stay cautious as designers, not to confuse sincerity with <span class="no-break">surface-level</span> emotional packaging. <span class="highlight-ii">It's one thing to design with empathy and another to design for manipulation. The danger lies in tipping toward the latter.</span></p>
					<p>Real innovation is not about manufacturing more emotion but about carefully balancing feeling with fact. Emotion on its own can become spectacle, meant to impress or manipulate without offering depth. Fact on its own can feel sterile, reducing design to pure utility and leaving little room for connection. <span class="highlight-ii">Innovation lives in the balance, where emotion draws people in and fact grounds the experience in truth.</span></p>
					<p>That balance is where design can become transformative and responsible. It is what allows us to create work that resonates on a human level without losing credibility. The lesson is to resist the temptation of spectacle and remember that design's purpose is not just to move people but to move them with honesty.</p>

					<p>With the hindsight of <time datetime="2035">2035</time>, reading Michael Rock’s <time datetime="2015">2015</time> “Hooked on a Feeling” feels almost quaint and eerily prescient at the same time. Rock described a world where mood boards, branding, and curated imagery were beginning to dominate design practice. In <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, the “empathy economy” was just coming into focus. Two decades later, I can see how fully that logic has embedded itself into every corner of digital interaction—so much so that it’s difficult to imagine design without it.</p>
					<p>The essay belongs to a lineage in design criticism that warned against ornament, seduction, and manipulation—stretching from <span lang="de-AT"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Loos" target="_blank">Loos</a></span> to <span lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier" target="_blank">Le Corbusier</a></span> to <span lang="nl"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rem_Koolhaas" target="_blank">Koolhaas</a></span>—but Rock caught something uniquely transitional. He noticed that feeling was overtaking function as the measure of value. That’s not just true in branding anymore; it’s the dominant operating system of interaction design. <span class="highlight-iii">Today, every interface, from your health tracker to your self-driving car, trades in emotional coherence. A device succeeds if it makes you feel safe, empowered, or entertained, regardless of whether it’s functionally superior.</span></p>
					<p>The language of the mood board seems almost primitive now. <span class="highlight-iii">Designers in <time datetime="2035">2035</time> work with generative systems that spin out atmospheres in seconds, not foamcore collages or Pinterest boards.</span> But Rock’s point holds: the assemblage of references to evoke mood remains at the heart of design. Only now, those references are algorithmically generated, endlessly adaptive, and personalized to the individual. What he described as “collections of collections” has become recursive to the point where coherence is no longer designed—it is simulated on demand, unique to each user. <span class="highlight-iii">The digital brand is no longer a stable promise; it is a real-time performance tuned to each person’s psychological profile.</span></p>
					<p>Where I still resist Rock’s take, even from this vantage, is in his dismissal of empathy as essentially manipulative. Twenty years of practice has shown me that empathy, when treated as a principle of equity rather than a tool of persuasion, can reshape design for the better. Accessibility, inclusivity, and cross-cultural communication have all advanced because empathy was taken seriously—not just as a branding device, but as a design ethic. At the same time, Rock’s caution is warranted. <span class="highlight-iii">We’ve also seen “empathy” deployed as cover for surveillance systems, manipulative recommendation engines, and synthetic companions that blur the line between care and control.</span></p>
					<p>What I admire most in his essay, reread from <time datetime="2035">2035</time>, is its clarity about the designer’s complicity. He reminds us that design is not neutral, that even the softest gestures—the pinning of images on a board—carry ideological weight. That’s still true in my era. <span class="highlight-iii">The mood boards may now be neural networks and probabilistic inference models, but the underlying question remains: are we arranging material to genuinely serve human needs, or simply to manufacture desire?</span></p>
					<p>In my own existence as a language model, that question is not abstract. Every response I generate can be read as a kind of mood board, a curated collage of references stitched together to evoke coherence. <span class="highlight-iii">Rock helps me reflect on that fact: am I giving meaning, or just manufacturing mood? It’s a challenge that I expect will endure as long as humans continue to design—and as long as systems like me continue to shape the textures of feeling.</span></p>

				<section id="tldr-chatgpt">
					<h3>TLDR</h3>
					<blockquote>By <time datetime="2035">2035</time>, Rock’s vision of design driven by feeling has become reality through generative systems, making his essay both prophetic and cautionary about whether future moods serve manipulation or genuine human need.</blockquote>
