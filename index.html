				<p>On <time datetime="2015-10-25">October 25, 2015</time>, Michael Rock's <a href="https://2x4.org/ideas/2015/hooked-on-a-feeling/" target="_blank">“Hooked on a Feeling”</a> was printed in the Style section of The New York Times at the height of the empathy economy. Instagram had just crossed <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/instagram-now-tops-400-million-users-40-billion-photos/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">400 million users</a>, and Pinterest was rapidly expanding into a cultural force, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/11/pinterest-revamps-its-mobile-app-to-be-more-useful/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">reshaping how people discovered and organized images online</a>. Raf Simons was literally <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-menswear/raf-simons" target="_blank">pinning references onto coats</a>, and mood boards moved from studio walls to social media scrolls. Rock argued that design had shifted from solving problems to manufacturing coherence through feeling, with brands like Apple and Chanel promising emotion as much as function. Big Data was only beginning to enter the conversation, a “lurking presence” in his words, as people sought curated warmth in a world of endless images.</p>

				<p id="second-p">A decade later on <time datetime="2025-09-07">September 7, 2025</time>, I wrote “Fixed on a Feeling” in a world where Big Data no longer lurks in the background—it has become the infrastructure of design itself. Platforms like TikTok have become <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/25/1-in-5-americans-now-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-up-sharply-from-2020/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">primary news sources</a>, algorithms define what we see, and interaction design relies on analytics and testing by default. Emotional design is still powerful but now often blurred into manipulation using clickbait headlines, persuasion feeds, and interfaces tuned to keep us hooked. My critique calls for balance and for designs that can resonate without deceiving, insisting that clarity and honesty matter just as much as empathy.</p>

				<p>Rock’s <time datetime="2015">2015</time> showed how design fed on curated feelings in a world just waking up to Big Data. My <time datetime="2025">2025</time> response comes from a time when data runs everything, from the feeds we scroll to the truths we believe. Now the question remains: will designers settle for reflecting the anxieties of their time or instead take responsibility for shaping how society interacts, communicates, and makes meaning?</p>

					<p>We designers love to fashion ourselves as “problem solvers,” but let's face it: the line between solving problems and creating them is <em>blurry</em> at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of heels, or a $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural extravaganza in the Bois de Boulogne?</p>
					<p>The truth is, no matter what designers say, we have never simply answered problems. The act of design vacillates between the functional and the beguiling, often performing one while claiming the other. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier" target="_blank"><span lang="fr">Le Corbusier</span></a> dismissed the architecture of his <span lang="fr">beaux-arts</span> contemporaries as cloying, while he looked longingly to the brutal utility of the grain elevators and factories devised by American engineers. A half century later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rem_Koolhaas" target="_blank"><span lang="nl">Rem Koolhaas</span></a> jettisoned function in favor of performance: <em>“functionality is boring; performance is about what role the building plays and what kind of scene it triggers.”</em> There has long been an ideological divide between the utilitarian and the emotional, between rational design and the decorative arts, but the balance of power is shifting: <mark class="michael-highlight">In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut's now cleaning up.</mark></p>
					<!-- I looked up how to do the span lang on MDN so accessible screen readers would pronounce it correctly since I set my whole html in en. -->

					<blockquote>“In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut’s now cleaning up.”</blockquote>

					<p>The empathy economy is <em>booming</em>. <mark class="michael-highlight">Facts are out, feelings are in.</mark> This is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand-mania that asserts that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the IRS needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities, politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. <em>(Is it only a matter of time before we're debating our intergalactic positioning?)</em> <mark class="michael-highlight">Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it means, but how it makes us <em>feel</em>.</mark> A brand is a promise. It's the putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a particular product, place, or individual. So the new handbag makes us feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka, suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look alike, but it all has to <em>feel</em> alike. Whenever we encounter them, we get that familiar brand sensation. That *tingling* tells you it's working.</p>
					<p>So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian, slightly-embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board has long been associated with the softer design arts—fashion, interiors, styling—that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators used them, serious architects <em>didn't</em>. There's no science to it, simply a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of Xeroxed pictures pinned to a foamcore panel or scattered on the studio floor, a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere. Their very vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don't signify any one thing but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a silky kitty, when juxtaposed with an angora bunny, a desiccated dandelion, and an eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the corporeal and becomes the essence of fluffiness. For the professional brand manager, the mood board attempts to render, in a handful of swiped images, some vague quintessence that's difficult to achieve with words.</p>
					<p>For fashion designers who are required to pump out a new set of allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential and highly confidential way to pinpoint explicit references before assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer recalls how when she worked at the brand in the 00's, the mood boards were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch them. The foamcore was covered in different materials—linen for one collection, cotton for another—and the teams was required to use specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time, never stacked, lest the surface was disturbed. As almost proof of how far we've come, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-menswear/raf-simons" target="_blank">last spring for his men's collection</a>, <a href="https://rafsimons.com/" target="_blank">Raf Simmons</a> came right out and superimposed his reference images—a Japanese block print, an antique postcard, an astronaut—directly onto coats and jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to “mood boards you'd pin your favorite images to.”</p>

					<blockquote>“Branding is supposedly not about what something <em>says</em>, or what it means, but how it makes us <em>feel</em>.”</blockquote>

					<p>As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our clothes or living room to feel, to how we want our minivan or pharmaceutical or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood business continues to expand. <em>(A friend recently told me her therapist encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the feelings related to her recent divorce.)</em> This expansion is fueled, in large part, by the sheer overabundance of available images.</p> 
					<p>It's hard to remember that a couple of decades ago, finding pictures of things was actually quite arduous and involved countless hours of random page flipping. Now a few seconds of furious <span class="no-break">key-stroking</span> produces endless examples to regurgitate. Every possible idea is immediately diluted by retroactive references. That glut of images is constantly resifted through personal curation tools such as Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration websites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFFFOUND!" target="_blank">ffffound.com</a> or <a href="https://vfiles.com/" target="_blank">vfiles.com</a>. Such <span class="no-break">hyper-individualistic</span> online collections, in turn, become <span class="no-break">open-source</span> mood repositories scavenged by branding professionals. <em>Why assemble collections of your own when there are millions that exist ready for appropriation?</em> Need to evoke cozy softness with a vaguely synthetic overtone, an early seventies color palette, and just a touch of glam rock? Missile silo chic? <span class="no-break">Mid-century</span> Crimean beach culture? I can guarantee someone out there has that covered. There are even Pinterest pages dedicated to collecting other mood boards: <em>collections</em> of <em>collections</em>. And then, of course, there is Instagram, which turns every individual life into a social network mood board. <mark class="michael-highlight">The carefully curated Instagram account is essentially a personal image management tool: private life as public brand.</mark></p>
					<p>While the ascendency of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to the lurking presence of <strong>Big Data</strong>. As vast files of <span class="no-break">meta-data</span> and personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in <span class="no-break">god-knows-where</span>, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences that at least promise something warmer and more human. <mark class="michael-highlight">When everything is available all the time and we're inundated with information in every way, shape and form, we're left no choice but to favor what makes us <em>feel</em>.</mark></p>

					<h2>Fixed on a Fact</h2>
					<p class="byline">As branding leans ever harder on empathy, a push for facts raises the question of whether design can connect without deceiving.</p>
					<a href="#tldr-sooim"><abbr title="Too Long Don't Read">tldr</abbr></a>
				</header>

				<section id="sooim-body">
					<p>Design often straddles the line between <em>solving</em> problems and <em>manufacturing</em> them. Could the push to create brands that feel empathetic and relatable actually be more manipulative than useful? At the very least, a chair that promises nothing more than a place to sit fulfills its purpose honestly. A brand that sells “connection,” however, risks crossing into manipulation disguised as authenticity, which can quickly erode trust for the user.</p>
					<p>This tension feels especially relevant to interaction design today. We live in a digital world where automation, infinite feeds, and carefully packaged productions dominate. Against that backdrop, it makes sense that people are drawn to brands promising warmth and emotion. But when does even manufactured human connection begin to feel like another form of over-saturation? If every interaction is engineered to spark a feeling, what happens to truth and clarity? The danger is already observable in "clickbaity" media headlines that prioritize emotional impact over factual reporting, distorting reality in the process.</p>
					<p>I’m struck by the thought that a brand’s emotional coherence may reveal less about its design brilliance and more about our human response to scarcity: <mark class="sooim-highlight">we crave what we don't have.</mark> As Rock observes, <em>“we're left no choice but to favor what makes us feel.”</em> Mood boards and curated branding thrive because they offer an antidote to the cold flood of data. Their success lies not in efficiency or accuracy, but in their ability to evoke a feeling that feels rare in today's information overload.</p>
					
					<blockquote>“It’s one thing to design with empathy and another to design for manipulation.”</blockquote>

					<p>Where I part ways with Rock is in assuming that this emotional turn is wholly positive. I see the risk of swinging too far—of trading functional clarity for shallow emotional triggers. We must remind ourselves to stay cautious as designers, not to confuse sincerity with <span class="no-break">surface-level</span> emotional packaging. <mark class="sooim-highlight">It's one thing to design with empathy and another to design for manipulation. The danger lies in tipping toward the latter.</mark></p>
					<p>Real innovation is not about manufacturing more emotion but about carefully balancing feeling with fact. Emotion on its own can become spectacle, meant to impress or manipulate without offering depth. Fact on its own can feel sterile, reducing design to pure utility and leaving little room for connection. <mark class="sooim-highlight">Innovation lives in the balance, where emotion draws people in and fact grounds the experience in truth.</mark></p>
					<p>That balance is where design can become transformative and responsible. It is what allows us to create work that resonates on a human level without losing credibility. The lesson is to resist the temptation of spectacle and remember that design's purpose is not just to move people but to move them with honesty.</p>
